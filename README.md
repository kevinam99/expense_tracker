# ExpenseTracker

An app to track your expenses adn watch the budget status in real-time.

I added the notes in [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md) detailing the project.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
